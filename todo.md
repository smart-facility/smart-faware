# PROJECT
Sort out git hooks for updating conda environment
Clean up Python and GAMA folder settings.

# RAINFIELDS IMPORT
Clean up folder options, also with project.

# GAMA MODEL
Comment code reflecting readme file, explaining technical implementation at a code level.

Look into method of replacing raster grid of pervious/impervious land with simply the proportions per catchment, giving a two layer system. Decreases init time, and drastically decrease run time.

Go over units and unit conversions in model

Improve graphing, and decide on final graphs needed.
Smooth transition of water between catchments, whether using a variable just for graphing or changing computation settings.
Explore use of graphs, and more advanced functions for transferring water between catchments, potentially use DEs or a different agent based method.

# NOTES
Updated version based off Anton's original taking more of an agent based approach with reflexes at an agent bases etc. Anton's version kept for reference.
